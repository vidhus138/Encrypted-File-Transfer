# Encrypted-File-Transfer
Secure Data transfer is based upon well-designed Data encryption and authorization systems. Transferring and storing data in plaintext form leaves them at risk of exposure to attackers, eavesdroppers and spyware. In order to avoid such exposure, powerful encryption/authentication systems use various mechanisms to minimize the possibility that unencrypted credentials will be exposed, as well as be sure that any authentication data that does get transmitted and stored will be of minimal use to an attacker. In this we are using Encryption technique for file encryption and will send this file to another client and a server
